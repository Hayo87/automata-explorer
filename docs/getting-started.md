### Running the Project with Docker

This project uses Docker Compose to build and run both the frontend and backend services.

1. **Build and start both the frontend and backend containers**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the frontend** at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Access the backend** at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Stopping the Containers
